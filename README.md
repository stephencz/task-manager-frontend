# Overview

In college, to stay productive and perform well I put all my assignments, quizes, exams, and studying into a giant spreadsheet.
Each row had the class the work was for, a brief description of the work, a tag identifying the type of work it was, and a date representing the deadline.
Task Manager is a web application built to replicate that process but as a dedicated, self-hostable solution.
Task Manager was built in React and React Redux. 
It is designed to be used with [Task Manager Backend](https://github.com/stephencz/task-manager-backend).
